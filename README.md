# LLDB for Nova
<!--
üëã Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

üí° Quick Tip!¬†As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions ‚Üí Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "LLDB" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!
-->

**LLDB** provides integration with the [LLVM debugger](https://lldb.llvm.org), including tasks to run and debug programs, attaching the debugger to an existing process, and stepping through code.

<!--
üéà It can also be helpful to include a screenshot or GIF showing your extension in action:

<!-- ## Requirements

LLDB requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

- [Node.js 8.2.0](https://nodejs.org) and NPM 5.2.0 or newer -->

<!-- Tool installation guide: -->
<!-- > To install the current stable version of Node, click the "Recommended for Most Users" button to begin the download. When that completes, double-click the **.pkg** installer to begin installation. -->

## Usage

Start debugging with LLDB's _Run_ action:

- Click the **Run** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button in the project toolbar;
- Select the **Project ‚Üí Run** menu item;
- Press **Command-R**; or
- Open the command palette and type `run`

### Configuration

<!--
üéà If your extension offers global- or workspace-scoped preferences, consider pointing users toward those settings. For example:
-->

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions ‚Üí Extension Library...** then select LLDB's **Preferences** tab.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project ‚Üí Project Settings...**
